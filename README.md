### Past

I was jotting some memory slices on [Learning is experience, experience is learning](www.lieeil.info), which is powered by wordpress.

### Future

I am now using Jekyll, more specially the Jekyll-Bootstrap, which is AWESOME and you should try it also.

### Thanks	
Thanks [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo), [Jade Dominguez](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and [GitHub](github.com) for all the possibilities.
